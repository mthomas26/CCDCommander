# CCDCommander
CCD Commander open source repository

This is the first open-source release of CCD Commander. See [here](http://ccdcommander.com) for details about CCD Commander.

This software was developed in the archaic Visual Basic 6.0. It has always been my intent to port this to a more modern language, but life has gotten in the way (and the cost/benefit has never quite been enough).

There are a number of dependencies. These are installed in an install package that is available [here](https://ccdcommander.com/CCDCommander.zip). That installer will include the prior _for purchase_ version of CCD Commander, but the CCD Commander exectuable here can simply replace the prior version. I will include source code for the installer on GITHub at a later date.

Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in collaborating here.
